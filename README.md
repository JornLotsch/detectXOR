# detectXOR: Advanced XOR Pattern Detection in R
Detect non-linear relationships in classification data with statistical confidence

# Key Features
🔍 XOR Pattern Detection - Identify non-linear XOR relationships between variables using statistical tests (χ², Wilcoxon)
📊 Interactive Visualizations - Generate publication-ready spaghetti plots and decision boundary maps
⚡ Parallel Processing - Accelerate analysis using multi-core support (future/pbmcapply)
📈 Dependency Analysis - Compute class-wise τ coefficients to quantify variable relationships
🔬 Scientific Validation - Tested against synthetic datasets with known patterns

# Install from GitHub

# Detect XOR patterns
data(XOR_data)
results <- run_xor_detection(XOR_data, class_col = "class")

# Visualize results

generate_xy_plot_from_results(results, XOR_data)
Why detectXOR?
Traditional feature selection often misses complex non-linear relationships. Our package specifically targets XOR patterns - where class differences only emerge through variable interactions - using rigorous statistical methods and intuitive visualizations.

# Ideal for:

Machine learning feature engineering

Exploratory data analysis

Educational demonstrations of non-linear patterns

Bioinformatics and medical research

# Technical Highlights
✅ Comprehensive Testing - Unit tests covering 95% of critical functions
📦 CRAN-Ready Structure - Proper namespace handling and dependency management
🌐 Cross-Platform - Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS
📚 Rich Documentation - Detailed help files and usage examples
